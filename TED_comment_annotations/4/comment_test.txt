1. FRONTLINE/World Fellows Rob Harris and Tovin Lapan traveled to Colombia in August 2005 to investigate charges that the Coca-Cola Company was involved in the violent repression of a union at several of its bottling plants. The soft drink company strenuously denies the allegations of union-busting and murder of union leaders. But there is growing pressure on the Atlanta, Georgia-based multinational from shareholders and U.S. colleges boycotting Coke to approve a full-scale, independent investigation of the charges.

3. Interesting.  I have just one comment for you to consider. 
This isn't "wrong" or a "mistake" it's crucial for individual health and success.  When an individual is already healthy (has an abundance of needed resources) to start with, it's logical/valuable for it to play it safe - to conserve resources to be used to create more value.  But when an individual is not healthy (has a deficiency of needed resources) to begin with, it is more logical/valuable for it to take a risk to get enough resources to become healthy.  So the starting point does indeed make a difference, logically.  We're not supposed to be objective when it comes to personal health, because what is good for one person now, very well might NOT be good for another person, or even us, later.  So subjectivity, and bias, are both logical and crucial for decision making.

5. It's a shame that at 13:12 Sam Harris degenerates into generalised assumption and the misrepresentation of bigottry and phobia which is in fact a bigotted/phobic action in itself. If Harris believes in science, he should be discoursing the relevant merits of his faith instead of slandering the religious beliefs of other faithful. 
To be sure..., saying "You bad!" is not saying "I good!". 
For Harris' intent to stand up straight and to be counted, he ought to assert why "He good!" while avoiding remarks that generalise three of the world's four major moral codes and avoiding misrepresenting the mistakes of one said moral code so as to strawman the others. 
Up to that point I was rooting for Harris but since he commits the same insipid and blindly faithful slanders that too many religious "demagogues" are apt, how is he going to represent a scientific moral code that purports to be morally superior?

7. It's not just about making sure arts are funded. This is one of the problems he's dressing, albeit on a more underlying level: nurturing creativity just mean funding the arts, it's about making sure kids grow up learning that no field is vastly more important than another. It's about teaching all the subjects in a way that doesn't squander students' creative abilities. Creativity is just important in sciences, mathematics and languages as it is in all the arts. Imagine this, a head medical researcher with no creativity. Do you think they'll accomplish anything? Will they bring anything new and important to the world? It is vital to the healthy continued existence of not only our species but the entire planet, that creativity is recognized as an invaluable asset in all careers and lifestyles, and that as a society we need artists and writers and creative thinkers just as much as we need budding scientists and revolutionary doctors and law makers with open and creative minds.

8. Greed is the problem, absolutely.  Why is the US the lead in obesity, financial collapse, and inequalities of many variations?  Money = Success.  This is the core of the American and now near global dream.  It's killing us in every which way.  A severley warped sense of humanity and our true aspirations. We are capable of much more. 
What do you expect from a society that now has corporatocracy at the top of the heap.  The corporate message has been so effective, not that there has been much choice through events of the C20, that it it almost mainstream globally. 
Good to see that voices from within are trying to make a difference.  However I am sorry to see that they may be too late in the light of the latest Federal Reserve warnings. 
I hope for the sake of humanity that we can come away from this enlightened without further war and suffering.  Greed is a really bad motivator, it's evil.  It's killing us....

Projecting this onto a drone pic w/ Arabic script, claiming it doesn't like apple "pi" further illustrates the absurdity of that form of propaganda meme.

15. i feel i have to note here, i always hear a lot about helping the poor move up, and away from poverty, as though promoting fiscal wealth is the only means to solve the consequences of poverty--starvation, a lack of health care, et cetera. and perhaps within the realm of today's economically driven societies this is true. but if upward momentum is the only solution to poverty, poverty will never be solved; as people will continue to scramble for the top, endlessly, stepping on the backs of those below them to get there. 
instead perhaps it's worth considering merely addressing the ability of all people to meet their basic needs, equally. i know the majority of this video discusses just that... Amy Smith's work using first world influences to help poor people find better ways to do common things. but she does seem to put a lot of focus on how little $400 is, and how these poor can also use the technology to profit. is that really important?

17. OK- so I had to respond to this one. First off- I'm gay, and was raised Christian. I've questioned many things about both science and religion. I do believe I have authority to speak on the Science vs. God topic. What if Science were just another language of God. For instance- we can explain through notation, music. We can explain through math the mysteries of the universe. Science is A language OF God. Science, in my opinion does not disprove God, but prove him. The more we find, the less we realize we actually KNOW. God, to me, is not measurable. Anything in science that is measurable is, in my mind, a manifestation of things that have been created. The nature in which they work are mysterious and awesome- however- HOW they work does not disprove God anymore than musical notation disproves sound. My point being, what if science and religion were married. What if we took a step back and realized that God is quintessential to our existence and science could prove both God and Evolution

18. Political issue? nope, totally not. I think we should open eyes for the global warming problem. I felt the weather conditions are changed a lot in this year. Only in one year my country had landslide and flood loads of time. Warning alarming is already started. But where is the big leader to lead people to the right direction? company? goverment? each person who lives in the earth?  
Do you think people don't know about this warming problem? That's why you needed to get advices from marketers? hmm..let people know about problem is enough I think. 
We need to learn. Learn about the solution by big system, as goverment. I'm not suggesting 'make a politics'. Education. children or adult whoever need to learn where we live and when we can live with this 'global warming' earth condition. 
Thanks for waking me up from non-interested person who part of the warming earth!

20. In my college, there is a small number of teachers who would believe in the hierarchy of subjects.  Unfortunately we work within a educational framework driven by politicians who hark back to the the easily measurable, and therefore politically exploitable themes of literacy and numeracy.  If we want to free up the creativity in our education system, we need to give the education professionals the space to do this.  May-be that's the crux of the problem, creativity is so hard to measure, and if the system (ie. the policy makers) demands 'accountability' we need to teach stuff that can be measured.

21. I am very much impressed. He hit the nail on the head! Meaningful education, instilling in young leaders not just an african pride (we r way too hung up on this concept) or knowledge but allow them to think through how to work in an ethical way, how the use of what they learn affect the community.  
We all have to start somewhere and education is key. You can tell people what to do but if they do not know "why" they are doing it, for what purpose, soon you will have another generation of selfish, greedy-tribalistic leaders, in Africa's case. To me, being a leader has to do with doing what you can, where you are with what you have for the "good" of those around you. There's nothing wrong with teaching the young to excel, to become judges, doctors, computer scientists, not for the sake of position itself but to be in a position to do "good". As an aspiring developper, that's what my mission is.  
Someone who physically builds roads is as much needed as a dentist, what matters is their character and whether either has been taught about their value in the community and how they can do the best in their roles. The goal is not to make people rich, poverty will always exist. A politician is as prone to greed as a bus driver-so its not about creating a class of the elits, its about instilling values/critical thinking patterns &amp; a sense of community that is greater than self. Some will fall through the cracks, but those who will get it,will do good where they are, with what they have...That's a leader.

24. I am not surprised by the criticism this talk has received and appreciate that so many have taken the time to watch and comment on it.  I know I have especially angered people who are part of the group I belonged to.  Still I contend that it is worth examining extremism as a cognitive processing problem and that the lines I have drawn between what I went through and historical atrocities are valid.  Looking at belief systems, especially those which fall under the umbrella of religion, as a cognitive functioning problem with potentially highly dangerous consequences touches a lot of nerves.  We need to look at it though, because extremism is a big problem and it happens inside the human brain.  It is so easy to label extremists as stupid or evil people but before extremism sets in there is vulnerability.  Maybe we can lower vulnerability through examination of this issue.

27. As Sir Ken Robinson puts out there, school kill creativity. My opinion is that the concequences of this fact are even more far reaching then the surface shows.  
Technology to me is evolution. Technology is the platform on which we pull ourselfs higher, both as an individual as well as a society. It is the platform of creative expression and the tool we use to carve into the world around us. By killing creativity, we slow this process down by unimaginable percentages. Everytime an individual, or a group of individuals, finds a platform in which they can express there creative capacity and combine this with their talent en knowledge we see amazing things. Success is inevitable. We think of it as the lucky few, a brilliant marketeer or find it that this someone has abilities others don&rsquo;t have. But we&rsquo;re all like that. We just need the platforms to express is it. Creativity is the key, or at least &ndash; one of the key components. We need to give creativity the weight back is deserves, so thanks again Sir Ken Robinson!

28. Its wonderful beautiful but not what a child needs at least not a young one.  Shilo Shiv Suleman mentions how the childs fantasy is being lost, but her books do not really inspire creativity and imagination  in a young child.  In a way its making a movie out of a book which is something that as a young child i hated how they destroyed the world i had built inside my mind, the faces, the voices, cities, countries, empires all stolen from me.  Instead of nurturing the young childs fantasy it is replacing it with yours and an imperfect version at that. 
it is brilliant work that may be ok for an older child especialy if it could take a larger part in making but it just is not the right thing for a young child 
hopefully you can understand what i mean...

29. TED says Ideas Worth Spreading??? Yet... 
TED's rules not only kill creativity, but reduce the ability of TED to reach a broader audience.

I could give my readers the minute &amp; second mark  to go to as a start point for the point I'm making in my blog, but as Ed de Bono says... we are passive, lazy ,consumers. And we are. 
I don't want my readers to work to get to the point, I want them to click and watch. Otherwise they might just click on by.

32. to A Latif continued...lastly you discussed the issue of proof.  
You pointed out that the historical record was scientific - had I known you believed this then I wouldn't have made the point. The banding of history in as social "science" is commonly loosely associated with the Euro-Germanic school of history whilst banding it as an art is asssociated with the Anglo-American school of history. As a Brit,  I wrongly assumed which position you were taking. Whilst I disagree with the reduction of all disciplines of knowledge to "science" we can agree on the idea that a range of sources can be used from which to derive logical conclusions. If you want to ask me about the combination of these various pieces of evidence it would probably be better to do it one by one. 
Finally, you did, as I expected take me to task over "faith."  You state "When Faith comes, supported by rhetoric, sophistry and polemics, neither logic nor evidence would work." I agree but that is not what I mean by Faith.

My main motive here to tell is that its human nature to have hatered which has been installed hundreds of years in histrory and comes from within. When I get to know someone from pakistan, my mind does not think I have to hate him, but something inside forces me to see how we are different(in a positive way as everyone below has done). This mindset gets fueled when things like mumbai attacks, kargil war takes place which I dont think so were politics driven if everything is arranged from pakistan. If a son is thief you should try to make him right rather than taking side of your son and denying it, which will make him a better thief. But, its really a positive attitude by pakistan youth to tell the world that we also need peace, but now its time these youth should be saying "OK THATS IT, WE ARE MAKING IT RIGHT AND CLEAN" go guyz.India will be with you if you support peace.

She makes use of identities in many of her books, well that's her choice but regardless of the western approach to "the rest" -writers from elsewhere, it's a fact that these topics are very popular, so much so that it became a habit of several Nobel prize winners to exploit it. 
I'm sick of this identity politics, which you aren't even aware of. If people want to cling on their identities and create newer ones that is their problem but embedding all that crap into novels and turning this into a habit is a very cheap trick to get recognition. 
Obviously, it's safe to write such a book after you get your recognition once you are done with conveying a prioris belonging to a prevalent, very non-fiction argument in the subtext of "The Bastard of Istanbul", which in the first place fired up her publicity and career abroad.

41. Hi, 
Loved this talk. I do not pretend that I could get my head around on the concepts discussed in the talk but I found it fascinating nonetheless. I like the way he conveyed 100 billion dog years from the big bang essentially subtley pointing out that time is relative. And basically everything changes to higher entropy and change at whatever rate is essentially the norm. So in a philosophical sense was there ever a begining. 
 I think it took all those billion years to form the goldilocks zone for a complex sentient life form to flourish. And there is a longer time to the death of stars and the eventual equilibrium. So maybe there is time enough to save the planet first, travel through space and find pockets of low entropy  or form a galactic community and may build a large enough machine to create low entropy conditions before another big bang which may end our time but renew another circle of life. Playing god some would say...

45. This has got to be one of the most absurd (yet dramatic) presentations designed to perpetuate fear in the average (non-technical) Internet user, while at the same time binding the masses using a common hatred. The speaker presents a good argument (with fantastic demonstrations of 20 year old DOS viruses) of why the Internet should have "elite guardians" to watch over us common folk who are clearly unable to protect ourselves. 
I'm sick of these myths that are created and fuelled by people like Mikko Hypponen who condemn the symptoms, but vehemently defend the cause (and let's not kid ourselves - Windows is the cause). 
Anyone who purports that the reason why 99% of all viruses and malware exist on Windows because it has a larger market share doesn't know what they're talking about. They hide behind a myth that sounds plausible to the average person, and one that is difficult to disprove (as it would require Linux gaining majority market share to do so). 
The issue here is not an operating system war - it's about protecting the Internet and making the digital universe safe. No matter how you look at it, and no matter what excuse you use to deny it, the real issue is Microsoft Windows (case in point:  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-13973805 ). 
I have a better suggestion for solving this problem: 
1. Legislate so the likes of Sony, Dell, HP, Acer, Lenovo (e.t.c.) are forced to give consumers a choice of OS at the point of purchase (the same way the EU legislated to give consumers a choice of browser). 
2. Legislate so that if a vulnerability in an operating system is exploited resulting in a financial cost (in down-time, stolen credit card details, corporate reputation, lost data, recovery e.t.c.), then the operating system vendor is held financially liable and must pay restitution. 
The insanity is selling a product with as many holes as Swiss cheese, and then blaming the mice for crawling through the holes.

46. The last thing I wanted to address was how schools have suppressed students' creativity but putting such a strain on success.  Students are encouraged to not fail on tests, to not fail as a student in a school community, to not fail as an athlete, or not to fail standards.  The interesting thing is, students become suppressed into one way of doing things.  They learn a way that works and they are scared to explore different areas and avenues.  The problem with this is that it actually lowers the bar of excellence.  We are taught to get back on a horse when we fall off, so why wouldn't we encourage students to expand outside the box and try to find something that raises the bar of excellence?  We are not going to test the boundaries of excellence and be able to add to the history of people of excellence unless we are willing to be creative.

47. I think the moment we lost our Creativity , is the moment we are forced to believe the concept "impossible". ( If a kid say : I wanted to walk through the walls , the parents will respond : it is not possible my dear. Why is it not possible ? The "logic" most of us taught to kids aren't the real logic of how the world really works. Just because we think that Particle is a hard concept , that doesn't mean that a kid won't be able to understand it , and even if the kid don't understand it , the kid might understand the concept one day. ) 
I believe everyone is creative(it depends on how to define the meaning) in some way , and is talent at something.  
In my view , school is really a good place to sort out the smart ones who survive the education system and create stupid people (to work as labour) .  
Talent is uselss without the proper knowledge and a way to use it. 
If education is base on interest and talent , I believe everyone will become a specialist , and technology will move ahead in lighting speed.

50. Religion (of any kind) belongs to the realm of metaphysics and as such is out of reach of Physics. The former invokes acts of faith while the latter recurs to observations and experimentation. Physics is agnostic by definition and objective by construction, naturally none of those properties belong to any religious belief. This doesn't necessarily imply that religions are wrong or right, simply that their principles are not part of the physical realm (understood as all that is explained by Physics). Even if Physics ends up providing explanations to every phenomenon in the Universe and describing every law of Nature (which is highly improbable) without ever finding a trace of divine intervention, it will not mean the end of religious notions in the same way as no physical proof for the Octonions (or any other mathematical construct not applicable in Physics)  doesn't mean they are false. 
While many people are religious based on pure ignorance many other consider themselves atheists or as they may think "science inclined" based on their mediocre understanding of science, just because it has provided them with cars, planes, computers and cellphones (whose functioning they hardly understand) and religions don't. That thought process is absolutely arrogant, blind and flawed. The purpose of science is not to create gadgets so people can have faith in it, but to produce verifiable theories and models that help us understand the world around us.

53. Hello, Bob! 
Sorry for the delay; just been too busy... 
"Regretably, I do not understand what you mean by "I'm 'closed' though, on what concerns the eventual "it just appears that all this is volitional." 'out there', other than our will (not free, though) and nature's workings, of which we are naturaly not aware of in its entirety (will we ever? I never, what would be its purpose, then?)." 
Perhaps, I was too clumsy with my words. 
What I meant is that, whether there's an exterior intent or not, on what concerns our will (volition), I'll remain skeptical about it. 
"It seems to me that thoughts and inspiration arise in us and some have enough meaning for us to reflect and then express. That expression then finds meaning in some one or some thing else ad infinitum." 
That 'sounds' a bit like the platonic view on how do we perceive 'reality'. 
That's a way of putting it; nevertheless, it'd make us mere receptacles of meaning and feedback relays of information, as expressed as follows: 
"Meaning finds us and gets refelcted back as our expression of that meaning." 
I do not think 'meaning finds us'; rather, I think we've got to deal with both meaning and reportability as our own responsability of creating it, testing it and, if possible, have any feedback on it. 
"THAT all this happens is enough for me at the moment without any need to understand it." 
I do respect your wise words. 
Cheers!

54. Allow me to share a case on choice.Back in 1978 I was the manager of a modern art gallery in Peru.A couple in their late forties walked in one night.After an hour of pacing up and down the exhibition the wife said she couldn&acute;t make up her mind between two paintings and would come back the next night and decide.The following night to her great surprise she found that the two paintings had been bought an hour before.  And when she was about to walk out without buying anything, my mother ( the widow of a career diplomat) accidentally on visit, stepped in:Madam,if I may say a word, let me say that during my lifetime of travel I have never regretted what I have purchased, rather I have regretted that which I have not purchased.There are still many beautiful paintings left, why don&acute;t you look again. In less than 5 minutos the lady client decided on 3 out of 17.While her meek husband made out the check, she scolded him on not having convinced her the prior night. Congratulations, Mr. Schwartz

1. FRONTLINE/World Fellows Rob Harris and Tovin Lapan traveled to Colombia in August 2005 to investigate charges that the Coca-Cola Company was involved in the violent repression of a union at several of its bottling plants. The soft drink company strenuously denies the allegations of union-busting and murder of union leaders. But there is growing pressure on the Atlanta, Georgia-based multinational from shareholders and U.S. colleges boycotting Coke to approve a full-scale, independent investigation of the charges.

3. Interesting.  I have just one comment for you to consider. 
This isn't "wrong" or a "mistake" it's crucial for individual health and success.  When an individual is already healthy (has an abundance of needed resources) to start with, it's logical/valuable for it to play it safe - to conserve resources to be used to create more value.  But when an individual is not healthy (has a deficiency of needed resources) to begin with, it is more logical/valuable for it to take a risk to get enough resources to become healthy.  So the starting point does indeed make a difference, logically.  We're not supposed to be objective when it comes to personal health, because what is good for one person now, very well might NOT be good for another person, or even us, later.  So subjectivity, and bias, are both logical and crucial for decision making.

5. It's a shame that at 13:12 Sam Harris degenerates into generalised assumption and the misrepresentation of bigottry and phobia which is in fact a bigotted/phobic action in itself. If Harris believes in science, he should be discoursing the relevant merits of his faith instead of slandering the religious beliefs of other faithful. 
To be sure..., saying "You bad!" is not saying "I good!". 
For Harris' intent to stand up straight and to be counted, he ought to assert why "He good!" while avoiding remarks that generalise three of the world's four major moral codes and avoiding misrepresenting the mistakes of one said moral code so as to strawman the others. 
Up to that point I was rooting for Harris but since he commits the same insipid and blindly faithful slanders that too many religious "demagogues" are apt, how is he going to represent a scientific moral code that purports to be morally superior?

7. It's not just about making sure arts are funded. This is one of the problems he's dressing, albeit on a more underlying level: nurturing creativity just mean funding the arts, it's about making sure kids grow up learning that no field is vastly more important than another. It's about teaching all the subjects in a way that doesn't squander students' creative abilities. Creativity is just important in sciences, mathematics and languages as it is in all the arts. Imagine this, a head medical researcher with no creativity. Do you think they'll accomplish anything? Will they bring anything new and important to the world? It is vital to the healthy continued existence of not only our species but the entire planet, that creativity is recognized as an invaluable asset in all careers and lifestyles, and that as a society we need artists and writers and creative thinkers just as much as we need budding scientists and revolutionary doctors and law makers with open and creative minds.

8. Greed is the problem, absolutely.  Why is the US the lead in obesity, financial collapse, and inequalities of many variations?  Money = Success.  This is the core of the American and now near global dream.  It's killing us in every which way.  A severley warped sense of humanity and our true aspirations. We are capable of much more. 
What do you expect from a society that now has corporatocracy at the top of the heap.  The corporate message has been so effective, not that there has been much choice through events of the C20, that it it almost mainstream globally. 
Good to see that voices from within are trying to make a difference.  However I am sorry to see that they may be too late in the light of the latest Federal Reserve warnings. 
I hope for the sake of humanity that we can come away from this enlightened without further war and suffering.  Greed is a really bad motivator, it's evil.  It's killing us....

Projecting this onto a drone pic w/ Arabic script, claiming it doesn't like apple "pi" further illustrates the absurdity of that form of propaganda meme.

15. i feel i have to note here, i always hear a lot about helping the poor move up, and away from poverty, as though promoting fiscal wealth is the only means to solve the consequences of poverty--starvation, a lack of health care, et cetera. and perhaps within the realm of today's economically driven societies this is true. but if upward momentum is the only solution to poverty, poverty will never be solved; as people will continue to scramble for the top, endlessly, stepping on the backs of those below them to get there. 
instead perhaps it's worth considering merely addressing the ability of all people to meet their basic needs, equally. i know the majority of this video discusses just that... Amy Smith's work using first world influences to help poor people find better ways to do common things. but she does seem to put a lot of focus on how little $400 is, and how these poor can also use the technology to profit. is that really important?

17. OK- so I had to respond to this one. First off- I'm gay, and was raised Christian. I've questioned many things about both science and religion. I do believe I have authority to speak on the Science vs. God topic. What if Science were just another language of God. For instance- we can explain through notation, music. We can explain through math the mysteries of the universe. Science is A language OF God. Science, in my opinion does not disprove God, but prove him. The more we find, the less we realize we actually KNOW. God, to me, is not measurable. Anything in science that is measurable is, in my mind, a manifestation of things that have been created. The nature in which they work are mysterious and awesome- however- HOW they work does not disprove God anymore than musical notation disproves sound. My point being, what if science and religion were married. What if we took a step back and realized that God is quintessential to our existence and science could prove both God and Evolution

18. Political issue? nope, totally not. I think we should open eyes for the global warming problem. I felt the weather conditions are changed a lot in this year. Only in one year my country had landslide and flood loads of time. Warning alarming is already started.

Do you think people don't know about this warming problem? That's why you needed to get advices from marketers? hmm..let people know about problem is enough I think. 
We need to learn. Learn about the solution by big system, as goverment. I'm not suggesting 'make a politics'. Education. children or adult whoever need to learn where we live and when we can live with this 'global warming' earth condition.

20. In my college, there is a small number of teachers who would believe in the hierarchy of subjects.  Unfortunately we work within a educational framework driven by politicians who hark back to the the easily measurable, and therefore politically exploitable themes of literacy and numeracy.  If we want to free up the creativity in our education system, we need to give the education professionals the space to do this.  May-be that's the crux of the problem, creativity is so hard to measure, and if the system (ie. the policy makers) demands 'accountability' we need to teach stuff that can be measured.

21. I am very much impressed. He hit the nail on the head! Meaningful education, instilling in young leaders not just an african pride (we r way too hung up on this concept) or knowledge but allow them to think through how to work in an ethical way, how the use of what they learn affect the community.  
We all have to start somewhere and education is key. You can tell people what to do but if they do not know "why" they are doing it, for what purpose, soon you will have another generation of selfish, greedy-tribalistic leaders, in Africa's case. To me, being a leader has to do with doing what you can, where you are with what you have for the "good" of those around you. There's nothing wrong with teaching the young to excel, to become judges, doctors, computer scientists, not for the sake of position itself but to be in a position to do "good". As an aspiring developper, that's what my mission is.  
Someone who physically builds roads is as much needed as a dentist, what matters is their character and whether either has been taught about their value in the community and how they can do the best in their roles. The goal is not to make people rich, poverty will always exist. A politician is as prone to greed as a bus driver-so its not about creating a class of the elits, its about instilling values/critical thinking patterns &amp; a sense of community that is greater than self. Some will fall through the cracks, but those who will get it,will do good where they are, with what they have...That's a leader.

24. I am not surprised by the criticism this talk has received and appreciate that so many have taken the time to watch and comment on it.  I know I have especially angered people who are part of the group I belonged to.  Still I contend that it is worth examining extremism as a cognitive processing problem and that the lines I have drawn between what I went through and historical atrocities are valid.  Looking at belief systems, especially those which fall under the umbrella of religion, as a cognitive functioning problem with potentially highly dangerous consequences touches a lot of nerves.  We need to look at it though, because extremism is a big problem and it happens inside the human brain.  It is so easy to label extremists as stupid or evil people but before extremism sets in there is vulnerability.  Maybe we can lower vulnerability through examination of this issue.

27. As Sir Ken Robinson puts out there, school kill creativity. My opinion is that the concequences of this fact are even more far reaching then the surface shows.  
Technology to me is evolution. Technology is the platform on which we pull ourselfs higher, both as an individual as well as a society. It is the platform of creative expression and the tool we use to carve into the world around us. By killing creativity, we slow this process down by unimaginable percentages. Everytime an individual, or a group of individuals, finds a platform in which they can express there creative capacity and combine this with their talent en knowledge we see amazing things. Success is inevitable. We think of it as the lucky few, a brilliant marketeer or find it that this someone has abilities others don&rsquo;t have. But we&rsquo;re all like that. We just need the platforms to express is it. Creativity is the key, or at least &ndash; one of the key components. We need to give creativity the weight back is deserves, so thanks again Sir Ken Robinson!

28. Its wonderful beautiful but not what a child needs at least not a young one.  Shilo Shiv Suleman mentions how the childs fantasy is being lost, but her books do not really inspire creativity and imagination  in a young child.  In a way its making a movie out of a book which is something that as a young child i hated how they destroyed the world i had built inside my mind, the faces, the voices, cities, countries, empires all stolen from me.  Instead of nurturing the young childs fantasy it is replacing it with yours and an imperfect version at that.

I could give my readers the minute &amp; second mark  to go to as a start point for the point I'm making in my blog, but as Ed de Bono says... we are passive, lazy ,consumers. And we are.

32. to A Latif continued...lastly you discussed the issue of proof.  
You pointed out that the historical record was scientific - had I known you believed this then I wouldn't have made the point. The banding of history in as social "science" is commonly loosely associated with the Euro-Germanic school of history whilst banding it as an art is asssociated with the Anglo-American school of history. As a Brit,  I wrongly assumed which position you were taking. Whilst I disagree with the reduction of all disciplines of knowledge to "science" we can agree on the idea that a range of sources can be used from which to derive logical conclusions. If you want to ask me about the combination of these various pieces of evidence it would probably be better to do it one by one. 
Finally, you did, as I expected take me to task over "faith."  You state "When Faith comes, supported by rhetoric, sophistry and polemics, neither logic nor evidence would work." I agree but that is not what I mean by Faith.

My main motive here to tell is that its human nature to have hatered which has been installed hundreds of years in histrory and comes from within. When I get to know someone from pakistan, my mind does not think I have to hate him, but something inside forces me to see how we are different(in a positive way as everyone below has done). This mindset gets fueled when things like mumbai attacks, kargil war takes place which I dont think so were politics driven if everything is arranged from pakistan. If a son is thief you should try to make him right rather than taking side of your son and denying it, which will make him a better thief. But, its really a positive attitude by pakistan youth to tell the world that we also need peace, but now its time these youth should be saying "OK THATS IT, WE ARE MAKING IT RIGHT AND CLEAN" go guyz.India will be with you if you support peace.

She makes use of identities in many of her books, well that's her choice but regardless of the western approach to "the rest" -writers from elsewhere, it's a fact that these topics are very popular, so much so that it became a habit of several Nobel prize winners to exploit it. 
I'm sick of this identity politics, which you aren't even aware of. If people want to cling on their identities and create newer ones that is their problem but embedding all that crap into novels and turning this into a habit is a very cheap trick to get recognition. 
Obviously, it's safe to write such a book after you get your recognition once you are done with conveying a prioris belonging to a prevalent, very non-fiction argument in the subtext of "The Bastard of Istanbul", which in the first place fired up her publicity and career abroad.

44. I think that people who believe that they can detect lies 90% of the time are just plain wrong. It might be true under laboratory conditions, but there are obviously so many people out there lying who get away with it, and so many people out there who are accused of lying that are innocent, that I think it is much too risky to say that we can tell 90% of the time when people are lying. I also think that the examples are not very convincing. Using politicians with obvious cases of lying to point out how you can tell people are lying is one thing when you are looking at it after the fact. But how many of these lie detectors knew it when they saw it? I seriously think it is dangerous to put too much credence in the technique- and people who believe they have the technique down could seriously get drunk with power. And how do we know that the people who are the "lie detectors" are honest themselves?

48. As a 'space coast kid' who watched every Apollo launch from the premises of the space center I carry a unique enthusiasm for getting us back on track to space exploration. NASA didn't get us to the moon--private companies did like Grumman, Rockwell, AC sparkplug, Harris and many others. It was not uncommon nor thought poorly of during Mercury-Gemini-Apollo for an engineer to jump between these companies to work out specialized problems. My father, now recognized as one of the space programs top engineers, went through 4 companies starting with his engineering internship and no one thought badly of it. The company had a contract and needed a solution. My dad and many others went in, solved it and went to the next issue. And none of us questioned whether things would work only how, when and who. We left unfinished business to be done. Fear, uncertainty and doubt drove public employees to be more concerned with guarding thier turf than taking needed risks. We  have to build a space access infrastructure with the urgency that built railroads, US highways and interstates. Then the stage will be set for business to prosper. But who will build that infrastructure? How will it get done? Inspired ambitious companies and countries will build it and they will do so by setting tight schedules and allowing risks to be the development tool needed to make progress, not the hammer which keeps us under the canopy of atmosphere.

Certainly, Technology is part of our evolution but fails to pass all the tests of natural selection. Why? Because it requires conscious-aware beings with an Intent. Not any god's but our's. Were it only for the survival of the fittest and we could have perfectly managed in the tropics, with little more than just clay huts, sticks, stones and (thanks, Chris) toys. 
It's this Intent which may lead us to utter or parcial anihilation or, to fine-tuned adaptation to all environmental conditions, through Biotechnology, Genetic Engineering - in a word - Technology. 
It's still evolution, it's still selection but it's not natural anymore, even if we concede to be an integral part of Nature: We're changing it with an Intent. Natural selection might bring us to this stage, where chance is now modulated by ourselves. 
Or, I might be completely wrong. Sometimes, I think that this preoccupation we have with 4/5 of the planet's 'technologically-depleted' is merely a moral issue; deep inside, some of us already feel they've got the tools &amp; the toys needed... 
Anyway, so far, we're the only beings which can state that termites do have some sort of technological skils...

56. To the misleading tag "Should we keep the outdoors out of hospitals?": But don't attempts to sterilize hospitals result in a lower total number of microbes in the hospitals - even if they get rid of more of the good bacteria than bad bacteria, my impression of what happens when hospitals aren't sterilized suggests that the practices are ostensibly necessary. And, remember, any species of bacteria can mutate into a lethal strain - some E Coli are good and some are deadly. 
I like what she says about designing a different bacterial ecosystem for our habitats. Air from the outdoors in neighborhoods that a lot of hospitals are in probably doesn't contain a very different ratio of human bacteria to the other ones.

58. One can&rsquo;t compare loss; obviously loss of life /injury would be far worse. For me, David&rsquo;s talk wasn&rsquo;t about comparing material losses with others, there&rsquo;s no point in that. He is showing us a very significant and &lsquo;different type&rsquo; of loss. For an artist a loss isn&rsquo;t necessarily just his own. It&rsquo;s a communication and as such it belongs as much to everyone. His film archives and memorabilia, family history, were inexorably tired to his long career work. So with the fire, it now deprives others of seeing it. That in itself is no where near a loss of a loved one, but when looked at in its context; the &lsquo;lifeblood&rsquo; of an artist to share with others his experiences, no money buys that back. A positive for David, is an artist never loses the experience of creating, seeks in his next work, his best. So at least that inspiration can be channeled into new projects. We can all gain inspiration from his attitude to the loss. I hope the &lsquo;snippets&rsquo; of burnt photo and film are a &lsquo;phoenix&rsquo; for him. ;o)

59. "However the Christian Bible has gained respect over the years for being different." - Peter 
If history has shown us anything, it is that documents should not be awarded respect merely for being different (think: Mein Kampf). I would argue that the Christian Bible found wide-spread "respect" because it was the cherished relic of a society of people enormously adept at conquering other peoples. In addition, those societies that were lucky enough to be in a position of power to overtake indigenous populations used that Bible as a manipulative means to an end (i.e: christian conversions of american indians).  
"Many have tried and failed miserably to rubbish it; myself included." - Peter 
I think I've mentioned the quote before but it is definitely worthy of repeating... "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence." - Carl Sagan. What the great astrophysicist was saying, in a nutshell, is that the expectation to substantiate an outrageous claim is placed upon the believer.
